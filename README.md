# PHP Lint GitHub Action

This Github Action runs `php -l` on all PHP files found in the current project. It allows you to easily and quickly check for 
any syntax / parse errors in your PHP files on pull requests or pushes. This is especially useful for code that is 
meant to run on multiple PHP versions.  

---

## Getting Started

Using this action to check for syntax / parse errors for PHP versions 7.4, 8.0, and 8.4 can be done with the following template:

```
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0
  - name: PHP Lint 7.4
    uses: dbfx/github-phplint/7.4@master
    with:
      folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
  - name: PHP Lint 8.0
    uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.0@master
    with:
      folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
  - name: PHP Lint 8.4
    uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.4@master
    with:
      folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
```

## Brand New Setup

If you have never used github actions, then create a file called phplint.yml in your Git repository in the directory 
.github/workflows. Inside of .github/workflows/phplint.yml put the following text:
```
name: PHP Linting

on: push

jobs:
  phplint:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: PHP Lint 7.2
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/7.2@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 7.3
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/7.3@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 7.4
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/7.4@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 8.0
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.0@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""   
      - name: PHP Lint 8.1
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.1@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 8.2
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.2@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 8.3
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.3@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
      - name: PHP Lint 8.4
        uses: dbfx/github-phplint/8.4@master
        with:
          folder-to-exclude: "! -path \"./vendor/*\" ! -path \"./folder/excluded/*\""
```

If you want to run the lint on Pull Requests instead of pushes change the ```on: push``` to ```on: pull```.

In the above example, your workflow will run the PHP syntax check with PHP 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4. You may remove any of these that do not apply.

## Ignoring paths

You can see in the above examples it ignores certain paths. You may add as many as you need by copying the example. 
The action ignores the folder `vendor` at root of project by default.
